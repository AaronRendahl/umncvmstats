## To get started

Various basic R ideas are covered in the [Getting Started](starting) page, including how to:

-   Open your class "Project"

-   Use the panes in Rstudio

-   Use the assignment operator `<-` to save the result of an operation

-   Use functions, that is, be able to call a function with one or more (possibly named) parameters

-   Use the pipe `|>` to send a value to a function

-   Use the `c` function to "combine" values together

-   Get unstuck by using [Control-C]) to cancel the current input line

-   Load packages using the `library` function

-   Create scripts and Quarto files and send commands from them to the console

-   Render Quarto files and open the result in your browser

-   `read_csv` and `read_excel`, with optional parameters `na`, `skip`, and `sheet`

-   `skim` to check that it was read properly

-   `mutate`, `as_factor`, and optionally `fct_recode` to create factor variables

-   `descriptive_statistics` to get a summary of descriptive statistics for all variables
