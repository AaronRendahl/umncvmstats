## Getting started

Various basic R ideas are covered in the [Getting Started](starting) page, including how to:

-   Open your class "Project"
-   Use the panes in Rstudio
-   Use the assignment operator `<-` to save the result of an operation
-   Use functions, that is, be able to call a function with one or more (possibly named) parameters
-   Use the pipe `|>` to send a value to a function
-   Use the `c` function to "combine" values together
-   Get unstuck by using [Control-C]) to cancel the current input line
-   Load packages using the `library` function
-   Create scripts and Quarto files and send commands from them to the console
-   Render Quarto files and open the result in your browser

## About Data

-   Reading in data
    -   Best practices for creating a data set in a spreadsheet
    -   Reading in a data set using `read_csv` and `read_excel`, with optional parameters `na`, `skip`, and `sheet`
    -   `skim` to check that it was read properly
    -   `mutate`, `as_factor`, and optionally `fct_recode` to create factor variables
-   Descriptive statistics
    -   `descriptive_statistics` to get a summary of descriptive statistics for all variables
    -   `count` and `mutate` (optionally with `.by` parameter) to get counts and percents for categorical data
    -   `summarize` (optionally with `.by` parameter) to get summary statistics for continuous data
-   Working with data
    -   `select` to select by column
    -   `filter` to select by row (see comparing functions)
    -   `arrange` (and `desc`) to sort
    -   `mutate` to make new variables
-   For summarizing
    -   `count` and `mutate`, to get counts and percents
    -   `summarize` for continuous variables, with `mean`, `sd`, `var`, `median`, `quantile` (with `probs` parameter), `min`, `max`, `IQR`
    -   Use `na.rm = TRUE` to remove missing values first
-   For comparing
    -   `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
    -   `%in%`
    -   `|`, `&`, `!`
    -   `is.na`
-   For creating new variables
    -   arithmetic functions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
    -   `log`, `log10`, `log2`
    -   `if_else`, `case_when`, `cut`
-   For factors
    -   `as_factor`
    -   `fct_recode`
    -   `fct_relevel`
    -   `fct_infreq`, `fct_reorder`
    -   `droplevels`
