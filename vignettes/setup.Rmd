## Installing R and Rstudio

Download and install both R and Rstudio. See links here:
<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

You need both; "R" is the software underneath that actually does the work; 
"Rstudio" is the interface that makes the doing the work much easier.

For Fall 2024, you should have R version 4.4.1 and Rstudio version 2024.04.2 Build 764.
You can check the version of R by checking the Console pane when you start Rstudio, or
by typing `R.version.string` in the console. You can check the version of Rstudio using Help > About Rstudio, or by by typing `RStudio.Version()$version` in the console.

## Installing packages

R has many add-on packages that allow one to do more specialized tasks or
make every-day tasks easier. We'll be using a set of packages called the
"tidyverse", and a package specifically for this course called "umncvmstats".

To install them, start Rstudio and run these three lines into the console.
Each of these will download and install not only the package, but all
other packages that it depends on it, so it can take a while (minutes, not hours).

The "devtools" installation may give you a warning about "Rtools"; this can be ignored.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AaronRendahl/umncvmstats")
```

### For updated installations only:
If you had a previous version of R that you recently updated to most recent version,
you should also make sure that all your packages are updated, using this code.

If you just did installed R for the first time, this is unnecessary.

```{r}
#| eval: false
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
```

## Setting preferences

There are three important preferences to set.

Under the Tools menu, select Global Options.

- For General (on the left side), and Basic (on the top):

  1. Unselect “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”.

  2. For “Save workspace to .RData on exit” select “Never”.

This preference is important as it prevents R from remembering anything from
session to session. Although that sounds like a good idea, it can make your 
work very difficult to reproduce.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.alt: Screenshot of the Preferences/General window
#| out.width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("preferences1.png")
```

- For "R Markdown" (on the left side),

  3. Unselect "Show output inline for all R Markdown documents".

I suggest you start this way, as that's what I'll demonstrate, but you're welcome
to try inline output and see if you prefer it.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.alt: Screenshot of the Preferences/R Markdown window
#| out.width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics("preferences2.png")
```

### File Management

Be able to download a file and put it somewhere. Be able to find your R
files.

### Creating a Project

All files in main folder, if want to use subfolders, talk to us about
"here".
