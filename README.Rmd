The umncvmstats package standardizes the function usage and the output for basic statistical functions to allow new R users to focus on learning the principles of statistics and statistical communication rather than on the details of R.

For installation instructions and a basic overview of using R, see the [Getting Started](https://aaronrendahl.github.io/umncvmstats/articles/starting.html) article.

See additional [articles](https://aaronrendahl.github.io/umncvmstats/articles/index.html) for more details.

To install without upgrading other packages, run `devtools::install_github("AaronRendahl/umncvmstats", upgrade="never")`.
